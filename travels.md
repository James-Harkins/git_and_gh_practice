My all-time favorite travel experience was a trip across Europe that I took
with my wife in 2016 after we'd first been dating about a year. We were 22 at
the time, which made our grueling travel days possible. We visited seven cities,
from Athens to Stockholm, in 14 days. This meant two days in each city: Athens,
Venice, Vienna, Prague, Nuremberg, Amsterdam, and Stockholm. We took the train
from Venice to Amsterdam and flew from Athens to Venice and Amsterdam to
Stockholm. It was a breathtaking experience from start to finish. We stood atop
the Parthenon in Athens. We toured the Basilica di San Marco in Venice, where we
also ate the best meal of our lives at a tiny, seven-table restaurant called
Covino. We took a train ride through the Italian and Austrian alps, ate
schnitzel in Vienna, and crossed Charles Bridge to St. Vitus's Cathedral in
Prague. We had a more somber, harrowing experience at Nuremberg's holocaust
museum. We walked the charming canals in Amsterdam. Last, we toured through
Gamla Stan in Stockholm with my Great Aunt and Uncle, who live in Sweden
with much the rest of my extended family. I am still not quite sure how we
survived those 14 days with only a backpack each and not half enough sleep,
but I will remember every detail until the day I die.
