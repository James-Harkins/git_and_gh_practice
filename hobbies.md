To begin:
I have too many hobbies.

I have been playing guitar since I was ten and I still play every day. I actually
play in a local band called Kaepora, which I started in 2018 with my oldest
friend, Ian, with whom I moved to CO back in 2018.

My other hobbies include reading, strength training, movies, cooking, and traveling. 
I also do a weekly music Podcast called The Butter Notes with two of my friends,
in which we discuss some artist or group of artists/albums.
