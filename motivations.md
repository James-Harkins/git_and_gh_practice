I am thrilled to be learning to code and changing careers. I have spent more
than five years in a rather unfulfilling, tedious administrative job consisting
of the same few tasks every day. However, not only will my day-to-day work
life become more fulfilling, but I plan to use my new skills for good. I want
to work for a company that is manifesting positive change in the world. There
is ample opportunity to work for a company like this in the Tech sector, so I
am confident that I will be able to find my way after graduation.

I happen to really enjoy the process, too! I studied Philosophy in college and
spent a few semesters taking logic courses, which set me up very well to begin
this new project of learning to code. I really could not be more excited to
launch into the next several months!
